A better understanding of genotype-phenotype relationships requires the integration of biological information of various kinds.
For biologists, it is difficult to search relevant information in these databases as the mass of information can be incomplete and hard to manage. These problems are particularly relevant in the context of genetic association analyses or GWAS (Genome Wide Association Studies), which allow to associate large regions of the genome (locus) with a phenotypic trait (trait). GWAS loci often include several hundred genes that need to be analysed in order to identify only a fraction of the genes associated with the trait under study.
In order to show how AgroLD (www.agrold.org) can help in this type of analysis, we took the results published in (https://doi.org/10.1038/ncomms10527) and tried to reproduce the experiment. The paper studied the key genes that are responsible of the panicle architecture in rice.
This repository contains the queries built to retrieve the data similarly as the paper analyse their study.
